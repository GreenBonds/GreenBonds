### ECB Bond PurchasesðŸŒ±

Climate Change has been one of the main topics on the political agenda for multiple years and its relevance has been steadily growing over
the past few years as governments aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability. Most notably for Europeans, 
the European commission presented its plan of a European Green Deal in December 2019 that aims to reduce emission to zero and be climate neutral in 2050.
In this report, it will be investigated to what extent the European Central Bank (ECB), the financial institution of the EU, has been purchasing green 
bonds in its Corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) before and after the declaration of a European Green Deal.
Key research questions include: Is the ECBâ€™s support for green bonds increasing over time? Is there a notable effect after the declaration of the New Deal?
In what sector and country green bonds are more or less frequently bought?


The process of finding answers to these questions start with considerations about how to measure or determine what is a green bond. Based on the findings, 
data collection is carried out from different sources in order to obtain a complete dataset. Then, different analysis techniques are applied to the 
data and the results are interpreted accordingly.
